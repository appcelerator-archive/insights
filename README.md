## Overview

Welcome to Appcelerator Insights!  With Appcelerator Insights, you can track user acquisition, engagement, retention and quality metrics for your mobile apps.  The Appcelerator Insights application is aimed for business users as opposed to the Appcelerator Dashboard, which is aimed at technical users.

This guide walks through the steps of getting started with Appcelerator Insights.

Appcelerator Insights only runs on iPads running iOS 7 and later, and Nexus 7 and Galaxy Note 10.1 tablets running Android 4.3 and greater.

## Using Insights

### Concepts

In the Appcelerator Insights application, information and navigational elements are presented as "Orbs".  Orbs are circles that present information and allow you to drill down to view more detailed information.  The thickness and color of each Orb represents the amount of increase or decrease of the metric.

Metrics are presented in four categories:

*   Acquisition: application installations or removals
*   Engagement: how many times and how long users have used your application
*   Quality: shows information related to application crashes
*   Retention: measures the number of unique installations vs. application usage

### Home Screen

After launching Appcelerator Insights, you are presented with the Home screen with demo data.  Before viewing metrics for any of your applications, you must first log in to the application with your Appcelerator Platform credentials.

**To login**:

2.  At the bottom of the menu, click the **Login** button.

4.  If this is your first time logging in to the application, a dialog opens asking if you would like to take a look at the user guide.  Click **Open User Guide** if you wish to see the instructions.  You can access the User Guide at anytime from the right menu.
